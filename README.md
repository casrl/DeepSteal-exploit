# DeepSteal-exploit

This repository contains system-level exploits to recover bits from machine learning model weights using rowhammer-based information leakage. The key observation is that using data-dependent bit flip characteristics of DRAM, we can cleverly setup in-memory layout of attacker-controlled pages and victim page to enable rowhammer-based information leakage using *one copy* of victim page. In addition, we setup several *anchor function* to monitor exection of victim ML inference and enable small *batch page release* to allow deterministic relocation of victim pages. More details about DeepSteal-exploit can be found in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.04625.pdf) accepted in IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, 2022.
